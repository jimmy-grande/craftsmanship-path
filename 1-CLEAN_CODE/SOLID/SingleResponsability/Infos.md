# Single Responsability Principle

## The problem
Every developer has probably seen codebases having a function that need to be scrolled because it is too long.  Most of the time, it is because this function is doing a lot of things. What is the big issue with that? I you are onboarding on a legacy project, you will probably take some time to understand what your function really do.

## The solution
To avoid that kind of problem,

# Practice time!
In order to practice this principle, I suggest that you realize a famous kata named [`FooBarQix`](http://codingdojo.org/kata/FooBarQix/).
